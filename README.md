# Color-Game
A game about color values using p5.js


# Instructions

How the game works is pretty simple. You type in the text box what you think the number of the specific RGB value is. While testing the game it was pretty hard to get the exact number so I made it so you can be off by 10 digits.

I made this for the #100daysofcode challenge and I'm pretty happy about it! There's still a lot of bugs and stuff I should fix so maybe I can come back later when I've learned some more to update it. I'll add in the TODO features that would be cool to have if anyone wants to try and implement some!
